            <h3>Biographical Information</h3>
            <p class = "bodyText">Jerry Hugo was born on 9/29/19 on the back of a EECS 360 lab instructions packet. During his younger years, 
                Jerry was often made fun of in school for some of his "abnormal" features; mainly hair that looks like 
                squiggly noodles, a stumpy leg, and an eye twice the size of the other. Sticks and stones may break his bones,
                 but words will never hurt Jerry. <br>Jokes on them, Jerry has his own profile page.
